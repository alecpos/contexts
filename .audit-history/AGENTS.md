# AGENTS â€“ Audit History

This directory stores historical audit artifacts such as call graphs and migration plans. Treat these files as read-only. If you run `npm run audit` to generate new reports, create a new date-stamped folder here. Do not modify or delete existing audit entries without coordinating with the team.
