# AGENTS â€“ Docs

All project documentation resides in this directory. Write new guides in Markdown and keep them clear and concise. Run `npm run check:links` before committing to validate external links. The `stripe/` subfolder mirrors official Stripe documentation and should only be updated for formatting fixes or link maintenance.
