# Testing Stripe Connect

Before going live, test your Connect integration for account creation, identity verification, and payouts.

Use testing to make sure your *Connect* integration handles different flows correctly. You can use [Sandboxes](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes.md) to simulate live mode while taking advantage of Stripe-provided special tokens in your tests. See the [payments testing guide](https://docs.stripe.com/testing.md) for more information on testing charges, disputes, and other flows.

When testing managed accounts, create them in test mode and complete the onboarding flow using test information. To simulate payouts, attach a test bank account or debit card. Review the [Connect testing documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/testing) for the latest steps and supported test tokens.
