# Testing Stripe Connect

Before going live, test your Connect integration for account creation, identity verification, and payouts.

Use testing to make sure your *Connect* integration handles different flows correctly. You can use [Sandboxes](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes.md) to simulate live mode while taking advantage of Stripe-provided special tokens to use in your tests. See the [payments testing guide](https://docs.stripe.com/testing.md) for more information on testing charges, disputes, and so on.
