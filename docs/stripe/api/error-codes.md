# Error codes

Learn more about error codes and how to resolve them.

Stripe logs every successful or failed API request your integration makes. Use [Workbench](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench) to review errors and monitor your integration.

Some [Errors](https://docs.stripe.com/api/errors.md) include an [error code](https://docs.stripe.com/api/errors.md#errors-code)â€”a short string with a brief explanation. These codes play a role in [our recommended error handling techniques](https://docs.stripe.com/error-handling.md). See the documentation on [payment errors](https://docs.stripe.com/error-handling.md#payment-errors) for an example.

Below is a list of possible error codes, along with additional information about how to resolve them. For convenience, every Error object links to this list in its [doc_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/errors.md#errors-doc_url) attribute.

You can also [trigger some specific error codes](https://docs.stripe.com/testing.md#declined-payments) for test purposes.
