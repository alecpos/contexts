# AGENTS â€“ VS Code Settings

This folder holds shared VS Code configuration. Keep extension recommendations minimal and avoid committing machine-specific paths or secrets. The `denoland.vscode-deno` extension is required for Deno linting and formatting. Adjust local preferences in `settings.json` but ensure they remain broadly applicable to all contributors.
