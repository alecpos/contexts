# AGENTS â€“ Dashboard

The dashboard contains example React components that interact with the providers. All components should be written in TypeScript/TSX and may use the `'use client'` directive when necessary. Import hooks like `useStripe` from `../providers` rather than duplicating API calls. Keep the dashboard simple and never commit production secrets.
