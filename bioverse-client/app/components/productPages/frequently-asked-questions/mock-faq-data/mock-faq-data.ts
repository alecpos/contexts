    {
        question:
            'How should I administer the NAD+ injection and what is the recommended frequency?',
        answer: 'Utilize the insulin needle and syringe provided to draw the specified dose, injecting it beneath the skin. Begin with a 0.1 ml dose and, if desired, gradually increase to a maximum of 0.5 ml (100 mg), up to three times weekly. Each 0.1 ml (equating to 10 units) contains 20 mg of NAD+, with the quantity increasing proportionally with the dosage.',
    },

    {
        question: 'Where is the best place on my body to inject NAD+?',
        answer: 'It is best to inject into fatty areas of the skin such as the upper arm, belly, or side/lower back region.',
    },

    {
        question: 'How much NAD+ is in each injection ?',
        answer: 'The NAD + content varies with the volume of the injection: 0.1ml(10 units) contains 20mg, 0.25ml(25 units) contains 50mg, and 0.5ml(50 units) contains 100mg of NAD +.',
    },

    {
        question: 'What items are included with my NAD+ injection order?',
        answer: 'Your order will include a 5ml vial of NAD+ solution (200 mg/ml), along with the necessary syringes and needles.',
    },

    {
        question: 'What if I exhaust my supply of syringes or needles?',
        answer: 'Additional syringes and needles can be acquired from local pharmacies or stores like Walgreens or CVS.',
    },

    {
        question: 'Is there a sensation upon injecting NAD+?',
        answer: 'Some individuals might experience a minor sting or burning sensation, but this varies from person to person.',
    },

    {
        question: 'When can I expect to notice the effects of NAD+ injections?',
        answer: 'Benefits, particularly an increase in energy, are often felt within one to two hours after injection. Do not exceed three injections per week.',
    },

    {
        question: 'Is refrigeration necessary for my NAD+ solution?',
        answer: 'Yes, keeping the solution refrigerated helps maintain its effectiveness.',
    },

    {
        question: 'What should I do if I drop my syringe or needle?',
        answer: 'Y If the syringe and needle remain sealed, they are still usable. If any part becomes unsealed upon impact, replace them.',
    },

    {
        question: 'When is it time to discard my NAD+ vial?',
        answer: 'Dispose of the vial 90 days after compounding or 28 days after its first use, whichever comes first, especially if the vial has been punctured.',
    },

    {
        question:
            'Can I use NAD+ treatments if I have a current or past cancer diagnosis?',
        answer: 'NAD+ usage is generally discouraged for active cancer patients due to potential unknown risks. For those in remission or with a cancer history, a licensed prescriber should review their case before approving use.',
    },

    {
        question: 'What should the NAD+ solution look like?',
        answer: 'The solution is typically clear. A yellowish tint might occur due to pH variation but is still safe for use. Contact customer service for guidance if the solution appears dark or brown.',
    },

    {
        question:
            'Why is TMG supplementation recommended with NAD+ injections?',
        answer: 'Excess niacinamide triggers a methylation process requiring additional methyl donors. Therefore, supplementing with 1000mg of trimethylglycine (TMG or betaine) on injection days is advised.',
    },
