The constipation is a result of these medications which slows gastric emptying time.There are a few things that you can do to reduce your chances of developing constipation including:1) Increase your fiber intake 30 g/day.&nbsp; Including vegetables, whole grains.2) Increasing your water intake to at least 64 oz of water daily.3) You may need to add over the counter fiber supplements such as Metamucil or Benefiber.&nbsp;If your constipation is severe, you can also consider taking over-the-counter medications such as Colace or senna which help to soften the stool and make it easier to pass or you could consider MiraLAX as a way to stimulate bowel movements.As you increase you may experience this more often. If your constipation continues after the use of the above suggestions please discontinue use of the medication and notify your provider for next steps.&nbsp;Please seek in person care if at any time you develop severe abdominal pain or nausea that is a result of the constipation.&nbsp;Alternatively, you can opt to stay on 0.25mg weekly dosing semaglutide which is the 1mg vial.

GLP-1 is what is better known as a&nbsp;\"hunger regulator\"&nbsp;rather than a \"hunger suppressant\" so we still feel those&nbsp;completely natural&nbsp;hunger signals.&nbsp;High protein&nbsp;meals will be of the utmost importance while taking this medication. Please prioritize protein in your nutrition plan (0.5g-1g of protein per pound of targeted body weight.) LET'S TRY TO AIM FOR AT LEAST 100G - 120G OF PROTEIN PER DAY.**Gentle reminder: the consumption of protein helps to release our own GLP-1 hormone, which acts as a “double effect” with our supplemented GLP-1 medication!&nbsp;Alongside adequate protein intake, I would also encourage you to ensure adequate fiber intake! Please aim for&nbsp;25g-35g of fiber per day. This helps our body to stay fuller longer and aid in excellent gut health.&nbsp;In addition, please utilize the “Plate Method” when portioning food to ensure adequate nutrition (50% non-starchy vegetables, 25% lean protein &amp; 25% carbohydrates).&nbsp;A healthy and sustainable rate of weight loss while taking GLP-1 medication is anywhere between 0.5lbs-2 lbs of weight loss per week.&nbsp;Please know that this GLP-1 journey takes time! I do not recommend setting such a short timeline for weight loss. If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to kindly/respectfully reach out.Thank you!

To help alleviate episodes of nausea: Consider implementing an electrolyte supplement (sugar free and low carb): the day before, the day of and the day after injection. Some examples of such electrolyte supplements include: Liquid IV Sugar-Free, LMNT, and Ultima. In addition, consider implementing over the counter supplementation to help alleviate nausea such as: ginger capsules, ginger chews/lozenges, ginger tea, and vitamin B6. In severe cases, consider implementing a dramamine. Ginger has significant anti-inflammatory benefits and can be a great help to alleviate nausea. If the nausea and side effects persist, we may need to adjust doses accordingly.REGARDING INJECTION SITE IRRITATION:Please ensure that you are maintaining a \"pinched\" mound of skin throughout the entirety of injection - this ensures that the medication is being deposited in the correct layer of tissue (subcutaneous).In addition, please adjust the speed in which you are injecting - a slow, steady pace is better tolerated by the surrounding tissue than a fast injection.Lastly, consider adjusting the temperature of your medication prior to administration.

Please make sure to refridgirate all 3 vials upon delivery.Your shipment will include 3 vials. Please refrigerate your medication upon delivery. Once you receive your package, start by injecting 25 units (0.25 mg) under the skin once per week for four weeks from the Semaglutide/Cyanocobalamin 1/0.5 mg/mL 1 mL vial, which is the 1 mg vial. You will then move on to the Semaglutide/cyanocobalamin 1/0.5 mg/mL, 2.5 mL vial, which is the 2.5 mg vial for your second month, weeks 5-8. It is common to increase to 50 units (0.5 mg) injected once per week for weeks 5-8. Then, it is also common to move on to the new vial using the Semaglutide/cyanocobalamin 5/0.5 mg/ml, 2.5 mL vial, which is the 5 mg vial for the third month, weeks 9-12, and inject to 25 units (1.25 mg) once per week for weeks 9-12 using the 5 mg vial.

This is Lea, Nurse Practitioner-C with BIOVERSE!Thank you for taking the time to complete and submit your check-in intake form :) I have recently reviewed your form and it looks like you are responding well to your medication.Upon reviewing your chart for your refill, a total weight loss of 12 LBS was reported WITHIN THE LAST MONTH. Our targeted rate of healthy and sustainable weight loss is anywhere between 0.5lbs-2lbs of weight loss per week. With that being said, your rate of weight loss was outstanding this month - but you are losing at a rate greater than 2lbs/week. BMI data from: August 16, 2024 at 12:40 PMHeight: 5 ft 4, Weight: 199.10, BMI: 34.17BMI data from: July 23, 2024 at 08:43 AMHeight: 5 ft 4, Weight: 212.00, BMI: 36.39I want you to be aware that losing more than 2 lbs per week is not healthy weight loss because it is likely that you're losing muscle mass rather than fat. Quick weight loss may also lead to a host of other new symptoms related to vitamin deficiencies, gallstones, and electrolyte imbalance, which can be life-threatening.For this reason, we will keep you on the 0.25MG (25 UNITS) dosage of SEMAGLUTIDE for the next month to ensure that you body has time to both physiologically and metabolically adapt to weight changes.&nbsp;Remember: the goal for therapy is for us to be on the lowest but most effective dose. This is because we want to ensure sustainable weight loss - if our bodies are losing weight too quickly, it will increase our risk of metabolic complications as well as pre-mature weight loss plateaus.&nbsp;It is expected that you weight loss will look a little different this month, but still a progressive approach. If you have any additional questions, of would like to discuss further, you can absolutely reach out. REGARDING YOUR MEDICATION QUESTION: Your medication may appear pink/magenta in color, this is because there is a small amount of Cobalamin (vitamin B12) in the vial which allows for FDA regulated pharmacies to compound this medication as a cost-effective option.

GLP-1 is what is better known as a&nbsp;\"hunger regulator\"&nbsp;rather than a \"hunger suppressant\" so we still feel those&nbsp;completely natural&nbsp;hunger signals.&nbsp;High protein&nbsp;meals will be of the utmost importance while taking this medication. Please prioritize protein in your nutrition plan (0.5g-1g of protein per pound of targeted body weight.)**Gentle reminder: the consumption of protein helps to release our own GLP-1 hormone, which acts as a “double effect” with our supplemented GLP-1 medication!&nbsp;Alongside adequate protein intake, I would also encourage you to ensure adequate fiber intake! Please aim for&nbsp;25g-35g of fiber per day. This helps our body to stay fuller longer and aid in excellent gut health.&nbsp;In addition, please utilize the “Plate Method” when portioning food to ensure adequate nutrition (50% non-starchy vegetables, 25% lean protein &amp; 25% carbohydrates).&nbsp;A healthy and sustainable rate of weight loss while taking GLP-1 medication is anywhere between 0.5lbs-2 lbs of weight loss per week.&nbsp;Please know that this GLP-1 journey takes time!

This is Lea, Nurse Practitioner-C with BIOVERSE!Thank you for taking the time to complete and submit your check-in intake form :) I have recently reviewed your form and it looks like you are responding well to your medication.Upon reviewing your chart for your refill, a total weight loss of 29 LBS was reported WITHIN THE LAST MONTH. Our targeted rate of healthy and sustainable weight loss is anywhere between 0.5lbs-2lbs of weight loss per week. With that being said, your rate of weight loss was outstanding this month - but you are losing at a rate greater than 2lbs/week.BMI data from: September 22, 2024 at 10:32 PMHeight: 6 ft 2, Weight: 339.00, BMI: 43.52BMI data from: September 1, 2024 at 11:05 PMHeight: 6 ft 2, Weight: 368.00, BMI: 47.24I want you to be aware that losing more than 2 lbs per week is not healthy weight loss because it is likely that you're losing muscle mass rather than fat. Quick weight loss may also lead to a host of other new symptoms related to vitamin deficiencies, gallstones, and electrolyte imbalance, which can be life-threatening.For this reason, we will keep you on the 2.5MG (31 UNITS) dosage of TIZEPATIDE for the next month to ensure that you body has time to both physiologically and metabolically adapt to weight changes.&nbsp;Remember: the goal for therapy is for us to be on the lowest but most effective dose. This is because we want to ensure sustainable weight loss - if our bodies are losing weight too quickly, it will increase our risk of metabolic complications as well as pre-mature weight loss plateaus.&nbsp;It is expected that you weight loss will look a little different this month, but still a progressive approach. If you have any additional questions, of would like to discuss further, you can absolutely reach out.Thank you! Lea, Nurse Practitioner-C  "},{"role":"user","content":"patient: Thank you so much!

The price for a 1-month supply of Tirzepatide 5mg weekly dosing is $449 and for a 3-month supply the price is $1186.92. Patients who sign up for a 3-month supply are able to access a discounted price for the medication at $395/month. This means you will receive a 3 month supply of medication in one shipment. \n\nIf ordering a 3-month supply, it is important to complete a monthly check-in with the medical provider so the provider can assess your dosing protocol throughout your weight loss journey. \n\nPlease let us know if you authorize this new charge by using this link: click here \n\nAlternatively, you can opt to stay on 2.5 mg weekly dosing Tirzepatide which is the 10 mg vial. The price for a 1-month supply is $449 or $702 for the 3-month supply. \n\nMaintaining a lower dose of your GLP-1 medication is more beneficial than discounting the medication. Discontinuing the medication could lead to significant weight regain, undoing the progress you've made.

Please prioritize protein in your nutrition plan (0.5g-1g of protein per pound of targeted body weight.)**Gentle reminder: the consumption of protein helps to release our own GLP-1 hormone, which acts as a “double effect” with our supplemented GLP-1 medication!&nbsp;Alongside adequate protein intake, I would also encourage you to ensure adequate fiber intake! Please aim for&nbsp;25g-35g of fiber per day. This helps our body to stay fuller longer and aid in excellent gut health.&nbsp;In addition, please utilize the “Plate Method” when portioning food to ensure adequate nutrition (50% non-starchy vegetables, 25% lean protein &amp; 25% carbohydrates).&nbsp;A healthy and sustainable rate of weight loss while taking GLP-1 medication is anywhere between 0.5lbs-2 lbs of weight loss per week.&nbsp;Please know that this GLP-1 journey takes time!

REGARDING NAUSEA: Please know that hydration status as well as foods we eat have direct correlation to nausea. To help alleviate episodes of nausea: Consider implementing an electrolyte supplement (sugar free and low carb): the day before, the day of and the day after injection. Some examples of such electrolyte supplements include: Liquid IV Sugar-Free, LMNT, and Ultima. In addition, consider implementing over the counter supplementation to help alleviate nausea such as: ginger capsules, ginger chews/lozenges, ginger tea, and vitamin B6. In severe cases, consider implementing a dramamine. Ginger has significant anti-inflammatory benefits and can be a great help to alleviate nausea. If the nausea and side effects persist, we may need to adjust doses accordingly. At BIOVERSE, we can absolutely provide you with anti-nausea medication (zofran/ondansetron).Zofran/Ondansetron is a dissolvable tablet that helps to alleviate episodes of nausea while taking GLP-1 medications.The price for a 10-pack will be $24.99 and the price for a 20-pack is $29.99.If you would like to proceed, please respond with the treatment package you would like and a coordinator from our team will create a medication request for you.

This is Lea, Nurse Practitioner-C with BIOVERSE! Thank you for taking the time to complete and submit your check-in intake form :) I have recently reviewed your form and it looks like you are responding well to your medication. Upon reviewing your chart for your refill, a total weight loss of 11 LBS was reported WITHIN THE LAST MONTH. Our targeted rate of healthy and sustainable weight loss is anywhere between 0.5lbs-2lbs of weight loss per week. With that being said, your rate of weight loss was outstanding this month - but you are losing at a rate greater than 2lbs/week.

Quick weight loss may also lead to a host of other new symptoms related to vitamin deficiencies, gallstones, and electrolyte imbalance, which can be life-threatening.For this reason, we will keep you on the 0.25MG (10 UNITS) dosage of SEMAGLUTIDE for the next month to ensure that you body has time to both physiologically and metabolically adapt to weight changes.&nbsp;Remember: the goal for therapy is for us to be on the lowest but most effective dose. This is because we want to ensure sustainable weight loss - if our bodies are losing weight too quickly, it will increase our risk of metabolic complications as well as pre-mature weight loss plateaus.&nbsp;It is expected that you weight loss will look a little different this month, but still a progressive approach.
