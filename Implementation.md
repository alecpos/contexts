# Implementation Progress

This document tracks the status of converting `SupabaseFullDump.csv` into TypeScript models.

## Completed
- Added a script `scripts/generateSupabaseModels.ts` which parses the dump and outputs interfaces.
- Generated `supabase/models.ts` automatically from the CSV using the script.

## To Do
- Review the generated interfaces for accuracy and adjust type mappings if needed.
- Add enums for `USER-DEFINED` columns if their definitions become available.
- Integrate the generated interfaces into the application where database types are required.
- Set up automation to regenerate models when the dump changes.
